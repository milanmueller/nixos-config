# Nixos configuration

This repository contains my NixOS multi-host configuration.
Right now, everything is still quite messy as I'm trying to establish a good structure for my config.

## TODO
* [ ] - Setup some DHCP Server or synced host definitions for wireguard network
* [ ] - Create Home Manager module to configure Cosmic (W.I.P)
